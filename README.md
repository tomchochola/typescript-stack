# [TypeScript Stack](https://github.com/premierstacks/typescript-stack) by [Tomáš Chochola](https://github.com/tomchochola)

✨ _**Clone and Win!**_

The TypeScript Stack provides pre-configured TypeScript setups that simplify the integration of TypeScript into your projects, whether you are working with a standalone application or a library within a Webpack environment. It streamlines your development workflow, enabling you to focus on coding rather than configuration.

## What is TypeScript Stack?

The TypeScript Stack is part of the Premierstacks collection and serves as a robust solution for managing TypeScript configurations across different project types. It offers ready-to-use templates that cater to various environments, including browser-based applications, server-side Node.js projects, and hybrid setups using Webpack. These configurations are designed to support complex build processes and ensure consistency throughout your codebase.

Each template within the stack is tailored to specific use cases, allowing you to choose the best fit based on your project’s needs—be it a frontend application, a backend service, or a shared library. With strict typing enabled and options like React integration, the TypeScript Stack helps prevent common errors and enforces strong type checking, making it an ideal choice for large-scale projects that require maintainable and reliable code.

Using the TypeScript Stack eliminates the time-consuming process of creating and maintaining tsconfig.json files from scratch. You can leverage its predefined setups to enforce best practices, ensuring that your TypeScript code is consistent, secure, and aligned with industry standards across multiple projects and teams.

This is my personal GitHub profile, where you’ll find public documentation and sample repositories for proprietary packages and templates from Premierstacks. These public repositories are designed to give you an overview of the best practices and high-quality code I follow in all my projects.

## What is Premierstacks

[https://github.com/premierstacks](https://github.com/premierstacks)

Premierstacks is a collection of exclusive, proprietary stacks and templates for PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Laravel. It was created to address the common pain points developers face with many open-source projects—quality, consistency, and maintainability. With Premierstacks, you get high-quality tools built with strict attention to detail, designed to help you build and maintain better projects, faster.

## Why Premierstacks?

I created Premierstacks because I wasn’t satisfied with the quality of many open-source projects. Maintaining high-quality code and ensuring long-term reliability is challenging when you’re not earning from the product. When you pay for something, it means the creator truly cares about its success and is committed to delivering the best possible outcome.

Like Apple’s approach with their closed ecosystem, I believe that true excellence can only be achieved when every detail is under your control. That’s why Premierstacks is proprietary software—it's not just about providing solutions; it’s about ensuring those solutions meet the highest standards.
